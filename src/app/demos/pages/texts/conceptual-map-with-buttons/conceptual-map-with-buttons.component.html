  <p>Depending on the length of the review and on its purposes, you can organize your literature review using different approaches. You can choose one of the following methodologies or you can combine them but congruently.</p>

        <p >This methodology is about tracing the development of the topics or theories over time. You need to explain and interpret this development by analyzing patterns, turning points and key debates that have shaped the direction of the field.</p>
        <p>For the review, it is important to set a starting date, year or period and justify the choice of this period.</p>
        <p class="m-0">This chronological approach is related to a historical one since it focuses on examining research throughout a period of time, often starting with the first time an issue, concept, theory, phenomena emerged in the literature, then tracing its evolution within the scholarship of a discipline. The purpose is to place research in a historical context to show familiarity with state-of-the-art developments and to identify the likely directions for future research.</p>
